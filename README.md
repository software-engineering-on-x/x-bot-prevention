An X bot that analyzes spam bots and blocks them from following, responding etc to an account.

## About

The idea of this tool is to prevent spam bots on X to follow, respond, like or interact with an account to not mark the targeted
account a lower score.

### Key factors 

Some of the key factors with its probability (0-1) that the bot will evaluate if the account is a spam bot account:

- 0 followers
- Only followed by unverified
- No posts or only re-posts
- No media
- No profile picture
- Gif spam
- No description
- Duplicated description based on other account that exists in current dataset
- No banner
- Sending only duplicated posts to multiple accounts

These factors will be saved in a configuration file that will be loaded on runtime. Check the configuration file here: [Settings.toml](backend/Settings.toml)
